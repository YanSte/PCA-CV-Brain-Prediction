## 1. Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma, a severe form of brain cancer. By leveraging radiogenomics and MRI scans, we aim to predict the genetic profile of the tumor, focusing on the presence of MGMT promoter methylationâ€”a key prognostic factor. This project is part of a competition organized by RSNA and MICCAI, making it a timely and impactful endeavor.

## 2. Dataset Overview
Data is sourced from RSNA and MICCAI, two reputable organizations in the medical imaging community. For more details, visit [RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/data?select=train_labels.csv).

## 3. Objectives
- To predict the MGMT promoter methylation status of glioblastoma tumors between values of 0 and 1.
